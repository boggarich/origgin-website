                                Our customers operate in almost every industry and country. They feed communities, provide healthcare, and help people get around. They run shops, gyms, churches, and they build tools for helping others run them too. They’re selling from their front rooms, and managing global enterprises. And they rely on the infrastructure we build.

                                Stripe processed $641 billion in payments in 2021. We have been entrusted with a significant portion of the global economy, and we need to continue to be reliable stewards of that trust.

So Ford can focus on building a global digital dealership, rather than processing payments. So Le Monde can expand its digital offering globally, not reinvent subscription billing. We take pride in freeing up others to work in the spotlight.

                                    The leaders in any field make their success look easy. But beneath the surface they’re in constant motion, critiquing their own performance, setting new goals, and continually reevaluating the most basic assumptions about how they approach their work. We’re still in the early stages of our growth and many of our biggest challenges lie ahead. You might think that Stripe has things figured out. While we’re proud of what we’ve built so far, we spend our time thinking about everything we haven’t done yet.

We are happy that we can support more than 50 payment methods (and accelerate rollout of new ones), incorporate more than 20,000 startups, and galvanize responses to climate change. But every quarter there are many important projects we want to undertake, but can’t.

Stripe is not a pay-your-dues culture; we will train you quickly and then give you substantial responsibility. We often have surprisingly small teams accomplish strikingly important work.

                            Successful Stripes are rigorous thinkers who appreciate that things worth doing are rarely simple. We want people who are not afraid to be wrong, who can enthusiastically back proposals they initially opposed, and who know how to support decisions with numbers and narrative. We operate in situations of substantial uncertainty and cannot afford either timidity or recklessness.

                            <br></br>

                            The global financial system can seem like a mystifying domain. It is not. It is composed of people and computers, just like many other systems you’ve worked on. Most Stripes don’t have a background in finance, and they’ve thrived here because they bring fresh perspectives. We want generalists capable of parachuting anywhere into our operations, learning about a field they have never touched before, and executing competently in areas far outside their formal remit.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                                We also want specialists who are already experts and want to spend several years advancing the state of the art in their fields.

                                <br></br>
                                <br></br>

                                We know that we cannot be successful without nurturing the careers of both generalists and the experts. People who thrive in high-conflict work environments often do not enjoy the experience here. We try to embrace kindness while still encouraging Stripes to take measured risks and act boldly, even in the absence of consensus.

                                    We aspire to make internet payments as ubiquitous and effortless as email. This isn’t simply a matter of ignoring borders; it also requires respectful dialogue with governments, embracing cultural differences, and building products that work in local contexts. That’s why we try to be physically close to our users, too. We want to share cabs with them in Singapore and buy food together in the darshinis of Bangalore.

                                    We are grappling with the challenges of operating at an organisational scale that few tech companies reach. We care about our culture and want to preserve the important parts while evolving to meet the needs of new Stripes and our changing business context.

                                    When you start at Stripe you will go through at least two weeks of in-depth onboarding. We will pair you with experienced team members to show you the ropes. And then you learn by doing. It is common for Stripes to work on things outside their domain of expertise, so we encourage people to regularly attend hands-on classes led by internal and external experts on everything from Learning to Code to Thinking Like a Lawyer.

                                    Stripes come from all sorts of professional backgrounds like engineering, design, operations, consulting, government, finance, healthcare, and education. We strive for humility as individuals and as an organisation. We know that we can do great things alone, but even greater things together. We have a transparent internal culture. If you are curious about engineering, running startups, corporate strategy, or the global economy, you’ll have experts to learn from. And they’ll be eager to learn from you.

                                    There is no magic to working with banking partners in Japan, moving billions of dollars around the world, or pushing the limits of browser animations on our product pages. We have smart people who sweat the details – who start with a blank screen, work until a product is ready, and polish until it is exceptional. You will be able to point to specific, high-impact things that didn’t exist until you created them.
